# APS360-Course-Notes
Textbook-Style course notes compiled in LaTeX for APS360 2023 Summer Course (Applied Fundamentals of Deep Learning).

I created this textbook as a resource for the open-book final exam. It incorporates materials from the course (taught by Professor Kaveh Hassani) and external resources, including the book "Deep Learning: A Visual Approach" by Andrew Glassner and the Udemy online course "PyTorch for Deep Learning in 2023: Zero to Mastery" by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Bourke.
